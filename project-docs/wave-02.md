# Wave 02: Container Component

Implement a `ChatLog` component and update the `App` component to display an entire chat log. `ChatLog` should display a sequence of individual `ChatEntry` components.

`ChatLog` takes one prop named `entries` (which is an array).

At this point, we can use the entire chat message data from the JSON file `messages.json` to test our code as you implement each component. We may choose to update the `ChatEntry` to use the `id` field in this wave.

## Styling

Note the rule set in `ChatLog.css` and consider how to apply it to the `ChatLog` component. Remember, applying the provided styles is not one of the main learning goals for this project.

## Tests

The tests for this component assume that the component is named `ChatLog` and takes one prop named `entries` (which is an array).
